# maps_and_sets
Lab for my CS 235 (Data Structures) class to get familiar with sets and maps.

## Description
In the same way that machine learning uses a training set to determine the probability that an event occurs given a set of inputs, this trains a map on the words from a document and then produces text that has the same distribution of words as the original document.
